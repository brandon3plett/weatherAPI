# weatherAPI

This weather API grabs the user's geolocation(with permission), and displays the current weather condition.

Technologies used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript/jQuery

For the API, I used https://openweathermap.org

The current temperature unit is fahrenheit.  To switch to celsius, just click on the unit displayed.

I will try to update this with the ability to display a 5 day weather forecast for the current location.
