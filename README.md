This weather API grabs the user's geolocation(with permission), and displays the current weather condition.

Technologies used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript/jQuery

For the API, I used https://openweathermap.org

<!-- The current temperature unit is fahrenheit.  To switch to celsius, just click on the unit displayed. -->

You can only grab the current weather temperature and condition in your location at that particular time.  In the future, I would like to display a 5 day forecast.

Update 10/5/20 - While the 5 day forecast code is written in app.js, I'm currently working on styling, so it is for the time being being commented out.  Also currently having issues with converting fahrenheit to celsius.
