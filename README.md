This weather API grabs the user's geolocation(with permission), and displays the current weather condition.

Technologies used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript/jQuery

For the API, I used https://openweathermap.org

The current temperature unit is fahrenheit.  To switch to celsius, just click on the unit displayed.

You can only grab the current weather temperature and condition in your location at that particular time.  In the future, I would like to display a 5 day forecast.

Update 9/29/20 - Added 5 day forecast.  Working on styling and fine tuning information and code refactoring.
